- **Paperless Submission**: Generates application documents (.docx) for submission, eliminating the need for printed copies.
- **Graphics Interface**: Utilizes the C Graphics Library for a simple and intuitive graphical user interface.
- **File Handling**: Automatically stores generated application data in files, ensuring secure and easy access.
  
## Application Types
- Leave Application
- Bonafide Application
- Uniform Application
- Inconvenience Application
- Document Request Application

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Libraries**: C Graphics, File Handling
- **Operating System**: DOS-based system (for running graphical interface)

## How It Works
1. The user is presented with a menu to choose the type of application they want to create.
2. Once selected, the user is prompted to enter necessary details such as department, name, roll number, reason, etc.
3. The system automatically generates a `.docx` application document with the provided details.
4. The application is saved in a pre-defined directory for submission.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the project using a C compiler that supports the C Graphics library.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create your application.
